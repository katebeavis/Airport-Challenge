# Airport Challenge

The Airport challenge was the first weekend challenge at Makers Academy.

We were briefed that we had to create an airport simulation where planes could take off and land at an aiport that had a maximum capacity. There also had to be a 'random weather mode' that was mostly sunny as opposed to stormy. Planes could only land if it was sunny.

### Objectives

To further our understanding of Object-Orientated-Programming and Test-Driven-Development.

### Technology
- Ruby
- Rspec

### To Run
```
$ git clone git@github.com:katebeavis/Airport-Challenge.git
$ cd Airport-Challenge
$ irb
    > Dir['./lib/*.rb'].each {|file| require file }
```

Now you are able to play around with the objects in Ruby. The objects are:
- Plane
- Airport

### To Run Tests
```
$ rspec
```
